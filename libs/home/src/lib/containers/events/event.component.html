                             Hanuman Jayanthi is observed either in Chaitra (usually on the day of Chaitra Pournimaa) or in Dhanu (called Margazhi in Tamil). Hanuman is the symbol of strength and energy. Chanting of Hanuman Chalisa, it removes all obstacles in life.</p>

                            The learning of the Vedas begins in the month of Aavani with the Upakarma and is temporarily terminated six months later with an Utsarjana ritual, to be restarted in the next Aavani. On this day, a Prayachittam is performed to pardon all the sins committed during the year. Homams are held and Poonal, the sacred thread, is changed on this day. This day is also auspicious as the Brahmins offer libations of water to their ancestors to whom they owe their birth and to the great Rishis to whom they are highly indebted for spiritual knowledge and the Vedas themselves. <br/>
                            The Gayatri mantra is a powerful vedic mantra, the chanting of which bestows upon the chanter many benefits including clarity of intellect. Every year, on the day of Gayatri Japam, the Gayatri mantra is chanted 1008 times, as a prayaschitta (atonement) for faults that one has knowlingly and unknowingly committed. Performing the Gayatri Homam, enhances the power of the mantra to bestow clarity of intellect.

                            The Full Moon Day in the month of Ashadha (July-August) is known as Guru Purnima.This was the day, when Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa was born to sage Parashara and Satyavati, thus this day is also celebrated as Vyasa Purnima. This day is celebrated in honour of the great sage Vyasa, who is seen as one of the greatest gurus in ancient Hindu traditions and a symbol of the Guru-shishya tradition. This day is observed by offering puja to one&rsquo;s guru and the guru parampara.</p>

                            The Worship of Goddess Chandi highlights the importance of feminine energy. Chandi Homam is one of the most popular Homas and the Sabha conducts the Chandi Homam during Navarathri. The core of the ceremony involves a recitation of 700 verses of the Durga Saptashati. With the recitation of each verse, offerings are made in the sacrificial fire invoking the Goddess. The performance of Chandi Homa, frees one of curses, obstacles and blesses them with a lasting health, wealth and prosperity.</p>

                            Skanda Sashti Kavacham&nbsp; (கந்த சஷ்டி கவசம்) was composed by Sri Devaraya Swamigal in 19th century. Devotees attest that regular chanting of this kavacham resolves all the predicaments of life and provides enormous mental strength. Sri Devaraya Swamigal asserts in this composition:
                            <br />VEDA Circle began organising a Skanda Sashti Utsavam at 6 different locations in USA similar to 6 veedu at Tamilnadu and celeberate Sashti Utsavam and Soora Samharam for the welfare of community.
