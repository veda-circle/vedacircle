                                The learning of the Vedas begins in the month of Aavani with the Upakarma and is
                                temporarily terminated six months later with an Utsarjana ritual, to be restarted in the
                                next Aavani. On this day, a Prayachittam is performed to pardon all the sins committed
                                during the year. Homams are held and Poonal, the sacred thread, is changed on this day.
                                This day is also auspicious as the Brahmins offer libations of water to their ancestors
                                to whom they owe their birth and to the great Rishis to whom they are highly indebted
                                for spiritual knowledge and the Vedas themselves. <br/>
                                The Gayatri mantra is a powerful vedic mantra, the chanting of which bestows upon the
                                chanter many benefits including clarity of intellect. Every year, on the day of Gayatri
                                Japam, the Gayatri mantra is chanted 1008 times, as a prayaschitta (atonement) for
                                faults that one has knowlingly and unknowingly committed. Performing the Gayatri Homam,
                                enhances the power of the mantra to bestow clarity of intellect.

                                Skanda Sashti Kavacham&nbsp; (கந்த சஷ்டி கவசம்) was composed by Sri Devaraya Swamigal in
                                19th century. Devotees attest that regular chanting of this kavacham resolves all the
                                predicaments of life and provides enormous mental strength. Sri Devaraya Swamigal
                                asserts in his composition:
                                <br/>VEDA Circle began organising a Arupadai Veedu Sashti Utsavam at 6 different locations in
                                USA similar to 6 veedu at Tamilnadu and celeberate Sashti Utsavam and Soora Samharam for
                                the welfare of community.
